Live coding Clojure + LWJGL (What Minecraft Java runs on)

10,000 rectangles updating instantly.

No restarts. No reloads.

Just poking the scene and watching it change in real time.

* Run
- Install dependencies: =lein deps=
- Run: =lein run=
- When running, an nREPL server starts and prints its port.

* Notes
- The project is configured for macOS arm64 natives in =project.clj=.
- On Intel macOS, use =natives-macos= instead of =natives-macos-arm64=.
- For Windows or Linux, replace with the matching classifier.
- LWJGL 3.3.x is tested against LTS JDKs; use Java 17/21 if you hit JNI warnings on newer JDKs.

* Live REPL
- Discover port: =clj-nrepl-eval --discover-ports=
- Example tweak: =clj-nrepl-eval -p <port> "(swap! lwjgl.core/osc-amplitude (constantly 0.15))"=
- Toggle wireframe: press =W= in the window.
- Toggle instancing (single rectangle debug): press =I= in the window.
