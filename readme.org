Live coding Clojure + LWJGL (What Minecraft Java runs on)

10,000 rectangles updating instantly.

No restarts. No reloads.

Just poking the scene and watching it change in real time.

* Run
- Run: =clj -M:run=
- When running, an nREPL server starts and prints its port.
- LearnOpenGL Chapter 1 (hello triangle) example (basic OpenGL triangle render): =clj -M:chapter1=

* Notes
- The project is configured for macOS arm64 natives in =deps.edn=.
- On Intel macOS, use =natives-macos= instead of =natives-macos-arm64= in the =$classifier= lib names.
- For Windows or Linux, replace with the matching classifier.
- LWJGL 3.3.x is tested against LTS JDKs; use Java 17/21 if you hit JNI warnings on newer JDKs.
- The upstream LearnOpenGL examples are available as a submodule at =./LearnOpenGL= for reference.

* Live REPL
- Discover port: =clj-nrepl-eval --discover-ports=
- Example tweak: =clj-nrepl-eval -p <port> "(swap! lwjgl.core/osc-amplitude (constantly 0.15))"=
- Toggle wireframe: press =W= in the window.
- Toggle instancing (single rectangle debug): press =I= in the window.

* CIDER
- Start the app with CIDER middleware: =clj -M:run:cider-deps=
- In Emacs, run =cider-connect= to the port in =.nrepl-port=.
- Live tweak example: =(reset! lwjgl.core/rect-color [0.9 0.2 0.2])=
- Alternative: =clj -M:cider= then =(lwjgl.core/run-app!)= from the REPL.
